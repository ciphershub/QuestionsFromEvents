This function, `truckTour`, is used to find the starting petrol pump index from where a truck can complete a circular route of petrol pumps without running out of petrol. Here's how it works:

1. It initializes two variables:
   - `start`: Represents the potential starting petrol pump index.
   - `cum`: Represents the cumulative difference between the amount of petrol available and the distance to the next petrol pump.

2. It iterates through each petrol pump in the `petrolpumps` list using a `for` loop and `range(len(petrolpumps))`.

3. Inside the loop, it unpacks the `petrol` and `distance` values from the current petrol pump.

4. It updates the `cum` variable by adding the difference between the amount of petrol and the distance to the next petrol pump. This represents the remaining petrol after traveling to the next petrol pump.

5. It checks if `cum` becomes negative at any point during the journey. If it does, it means the truck couldn't reach the next petrol pump with the available petrol. In such a case, it updates the `start` variable to the index of the next petrol pump (`i + 1`) and resets `cum` to 0. This indicates that the current petrol pump cannot be the starting point, and the next petrol pump should be considered as a potential starting point.

6. After iterating through all petrol pumps, it returns the `start` variable, which represents the index of the petrol pump from where the truck can start the circular route without running out of petrol.

This algorithm efficiently finds the starting petrol pump with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of petrol pumps in the `petrolpumps` list. It only requires a single pass through the list to determine the starting point.
