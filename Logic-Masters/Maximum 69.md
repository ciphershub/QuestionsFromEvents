**STRING CONVERSION APPROACH

The Python function takes an integer `num` as input and returns the largest possible number you can get by changing at most one digit from a 6 or a 9. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Converting the integer to a string:** 
   - The first line `a = list(str(num))` converts the input number `num` to a string. Then, it creates a list `a` by splitting the string into individual characters. This allows us to modify each digit of the number separately.

2. **Finding the leftmost 6 and replacing it with a 9:**
   - The `for` loop iterates through each character (digit) in the list `a`.
   - Inside the loop, the condition `if a[i] == "6"` checks if the current character is a "6".
     - If it is a 6, the line `a[i] = "9"` replaces that character with a "9".
     - The `break` statement exits the loop after the first replacement is made. This ensures that only one digit is changed at most.

3. **Converting the modified list back to an integer:**
   - After the loop, the list `a` contains the modified digits.
   - The line `return int(''.join(a))` joins the elements of the list `a` back into a string. 
   - Finally, it converts the resulting string back to an integer using `int()`.

Overall, this function achieves the goal of finding the maximum number possible by changing at most one digit 6 to a 9 in the original input number.


**INTEGER APPROACH

UNDERLYING CONCEPT

- As mentioned in the first approach, the goal in this question is to find the last occurence of 6.
- Given an integer, suppose 9699
- integer % 10 = last digit(9 here)
- integer / 10 = digits excluding last digit(969 here)
- 9699 = (9*1000) + (6*100) + (9*10) + (9*1)
- What can be noticed above is that the one digit is the only digit not divisible by 10, hence integer%10 will always give the last digit.

  Here is the breakdown of the code
1. **Setting intial variable: **
   - We take a temp variable and set it to num(input number). This is done due to the fact that we want to keep the original number intact.
   - sinind = -1, is a variable used to keep track of the latest occurence of 6.
   - i = 0, i is the digit index

2. **loop: **
   - begin a while loop, temp >0
   - at each iteration we use temp%10 to get the current digit.
   - if current digit = 6, we set sixind to i. During the loop, the larger digit will reflesh the sixindex. So when the loop ends, we got the biggest 6 digit.
   - else we move one digit to the left, by simply dividing temp by 10.
   - at last we increase i by 1
 
3. **getting the final output: **
   - if the number six is not present, represented by the condition sixind = -1, we return num
   - else we add 3 to the last occurence of 6, by using num + 3*(10**sixind), where ** represents power
